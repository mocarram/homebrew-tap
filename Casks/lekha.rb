  # The Homebrew build is unsigned, so the in-app updater (Squirrel.Mac) cannot
  # apply updates - Homebrew owns them. Leaving auto_updates at its default
  # (false) keeps `brew upgrade --cask lekha` as the real update path; a future
  # signed direct-download build would set this true and self-update instead.
